# Today I feel MEAN - Welcome to MyApplication

## Description
With this project I would like to give the user the possibility to download my application documents with the help of a verification code. 
The access is possible with a verification code.
The application was created with the mobile first approach.

## Technology Stack

For my project I chose the MEAN stack. It is a full-stack, JavaScript-based framework for developing web applications. <br>
MEAN stands for..

    ..MongoDB - document database
    ..Express(.js) - Node.js web framework
    ..Angular(.js) - a client-side JavaScript framework
    ..Node(.js) - the premier JavaScript web server

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.0.6.

3.1 MONGODB_URI_PROD="Example URI" <br>
3.2 MONGODB_PORT_PROD="Example Port" <br>

4. Create folder files\pdf\ and insert documents

The local environment should now run with "node server.js" and "ng serve" commands.
